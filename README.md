# Customer Support Ticket Triage System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Week-1 internship assignment focused on understanding how real-world Python projects are structured and submitted.

Companies receive a large number of customer support tickets every day. Some issues are urgent, while others are normal.  
This project demonstrates a basic system that works with customer support ticket data and generates a final report in CSV format.

The main goal of this project is to learn:
- How to use Google Colab for Python development
- How to work with CSV datasets
- How to submit a professional project using GitHub

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Kaggle Dataset  
- GitHub  

---

## 📂 Project Files
- `Week1_Customer_Support_Triage.ipynb`  
  → Google Colab notebook containing Python code for loading and processing the dataset.

- `customer_support_ticket_output.csv`  
  → Final output file generated after running the notebook.  
  This file represents the processed data and acts as the project report.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. A customer support ticket dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.
2. The dataset was uploaded and loaded in Google Colab using Python.
3. The data was processed and reviewed using Pandas.
4. A final output CSV file was generated from the notebook.
5. The notebook and output file were uploaded to GitHub for submission.
